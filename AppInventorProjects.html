      <p>This is a remix of the App Inventor App, Space Invaders. This remix differs from the original as it has some new features that allow the game to flow smoothly, and new sound effects based off of the original Space Invaders.</p>

      <p>This project is an app which is based off of the original Duck Hunt game for the NES. I made this with my partner, Ida Ma. I think that this project well suits the needs of the consumer, as it is a very fun and entertaining game to play during instances when you are bored. It’s very challenging and requires precision and patience in order to pass the levels. The player can feel very satisfied as they manage to reach higher levels and shoot more ducks, and as such, I believe that this game truly does satisfy the consumer’s needs.</p>
