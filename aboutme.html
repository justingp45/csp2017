    <font face="Comic Sans MS"><p align="justify">My name is Justin Perez. I’m that one short sophomore who’s currently sitting in the front of the class. I go to school, play tennis, then I go home and drown in the piles of homework that I should’ve started 4 hours earlier.</p>

    <ul align="left">
      <li>I'm Filipino. No, I'm not Mexican, don't ask.</li>
      <li>I like to play video games. I'm basically a potato at home.</li>
      <li>I like to listen to music.</li>
      <li>I play tennis. I'm on the tennis team here at Rowland too. (I played for JV last year.)</li>
      <li>I stay up late. A lot. Probably explains why I'm short.</li>
      <li>I learned how to play 3 different instruments because my parents really wanted me to get into music. I ended up quitting all 3 due to time constraints or just general loss of interest.</li>
      <li>I'm not good at studying. I actually can't focus on a textbook for more than 2o minutes.</li>
      <li>I'm a member of Key Club. Club Fair Day is on September 1st, so you should come and check out our booth or ask me for signups :^).</li>
      <li>I love rice. I eat it a lot. Pretty much almost every day. I actually want some right now. I'm hungry.</li>
      <font color="blue"><li>My favorite color is blue. I like it so much that I made this entire bullet blue.</li></font>
